V 1.0.1

### Known bugs ###
1. Upon fetching data from databases, if database name is incorrect, will still recognize the name as correct until actually fetching data
Results in a crash afterwards.

2. If entering spaces as database names, gets the data from the first database (master?)
- ... why would you even do this... ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )
