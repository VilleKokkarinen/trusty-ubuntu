 Add a feature:
 IF Data fetching fails on a database, SKIP the base. and write a .txt file with the error code & name of the database
 eg. BASE1_FAIL.txt. Then move on to the next base.
 (Could also Hightlight the databasename in the Databases.txt File with something you can ctrl+f (## // ** \\ §§)

Fix some / check all Firebird side Try catches.
Fix console messages in firebird side
 
* Possibly a GUI

* Improved performance
