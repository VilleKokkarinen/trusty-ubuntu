 TODO improvements into the
 Edition V:1.0.6
  
  (3)> Fix console messages in firebird side->

  (4)> some of them currently overlap, or don't go to the correct lines
        > console.setcursorposition(@,@); <-
        > console.writeline(@,@); <-
  
(5)> Remove unnecessary integers, strings.

(6)> Edit the config file data fetching to a specific search function, rather than line specific:
eg: Finds the line with the word(s) "Dates", then takes the string written after the "=" character on that line.

(7)> Create a User "manual" of this program, (with screenshots?) ;) ->
     > How to use, how to edit config, how to use the "NameLister.Exe"
     > What to remember when using. (?)
 
  
* Possibly a GUI
* Improved performance
* Automatic data fetching, everytime a update happens within a database, replace old file.
